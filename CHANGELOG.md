- Add modal-based Admin PIN setup on first access and hide Admin PIN management behind a change link.
- Add a simple Instructor Sign-In kiosk header and remove the Site field so sign-ins stay focused on device-configured defaults.
- Add Admin “Void last sign-in” to mark mistaken entries VOID and exclude them from payroll export (no delete).
- Add local Admin PIN gating with logout control so kiosks require a PIN before access.
